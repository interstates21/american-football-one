        <h3>‚ó™ What is orienteering?</h3>
        <p>
        <span class="fat">Orienteering</span> is a group of sports that require navigational
         skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point 
         in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed. 
         Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared 
         orienteering map, which they use to find control points.
          Originally a training exercise in land navigation for military officers,
           orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and 
           the most popular is foot orienteering. For the purposes of this article,
            foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, 
            but almost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a 
            map is a type of orienteering. 
            <br>Orienteering is included in the programs of world sporting 
            events including the World Games (see Orienteering at the World Games) and World Police and Fire Games.

        <h3>‚ó™ Equipment</h3>
        <p>The basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing. 
            Most national bodies recommend that a whistle be carried for safety. 
            <br>
            Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment: </p>
            <ul> 
            <li>‚úß A thumb compass, or protractor compass on a short wrist cord. </li>
            <li>‚úß A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions. </li>
            <li>‚úß A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.</li>
            <li>‚úß A map board, fixed to the handlebars or worn on the arm or strapped to the torso (MTB-O, Ski-o and ARDF only). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can refer to during a race,
              so GPS and other electronic navigation devices are not used. (ARDF may allow them at some events). 
              GPS logging devices that track and record position, without allowing competitors to refer 
              to the data during the race, are permitted, and are increasingly being used for post-race 
              route-choice analysis and live tracking for event spectators.</p>

        <h3> ‚ó™ Variations</h3>
        <p>
            Orienteering sports combine significant navigation with a specific method of travel. 
            Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport 
            requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and course design.
            <br>

            International Orienteering Federation, the governing body of the sport, 
            currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>üèÉ Foot orienteering (FootO)</li>
            <li>üö¥ Mountain bike orienteering (MTBO)</li>
            <li>‚õ∑ Ski orienteering (SkiO)</li>
            <li>üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ Trail orienteering (TrailO)</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>
            Moreover, International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport: </p>
            <ul><li>
                ‚úß Amateur radio direction finding (Radio orienteering or ARDF) 
                [including variants Fox Oring and Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area (ROCA)]
            </li></ul>
            <p>
            Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>‚úß Biathlon orienteering</li>
            <li>‚úß Canoe orienteering</li>

            <li>‚úß SportLabyrinth ‚Äì micro orienteering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Adventure racing is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the race.
